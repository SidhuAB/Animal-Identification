# Animal-Identification
Classify Different types of animal.
Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of
animals in the wild would revolutionize our ability to study and conserve ecosystems.
Implementing Machine Learning using python for image processing can become an
essential tool for ecologists, enabling them to study population sizes and distributions, and
evaluate habitat use.We focus on harnessing computer vision to automatically extract the
species, number, presence of animals.These tasks can be challenging even for humans.
Images taken from camera are rarely perfect, and many images contain animals that are far
away, too close, or only partially visible..Automatic animal identification and counting
would improve all biology missions that require identifying species and counting
individuals, including animal monitoring and management, examining biodiversity, and
population estimation.
